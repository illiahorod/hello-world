# hello-world
<h1>Getting started with GitHub</h1>
<p>My name is Illia and I am from Ukraine. In the beginning of the year 2018 I got interested in programming. As it turned out, you can learn to code all by yourself and, in most cases, computer science degree is not required to apply for work. I have an upper-intermediate level of written and spoken English. It helps me to take the latest programming courses that are available online. Up to this moment (21.05.2018) I know the basics of programming, I also finished several courses on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My goal is to master Web Development and to learn other programming languages, for instance, Python.</p>
